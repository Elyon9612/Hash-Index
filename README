This is the work of implement Linear hash index
Part of work reference by https://github.com/Priyansh2/linear_hashing

Here is the requirement:
Assume that we have a relation Employee(id, name, bio, manager-id).
The values of id andmanager-id are character strings with fixed size of 8 bytes.
The values of name and bio arecharacter strings and take at most 200 and 500 bytes. 
Note that as opposed to the values of idand manager-id, the sizes of the values of name (bio) are not fixed and are between 1 to 200 (500)bytes.
The size of each block is 4096 bytes (4KB). The size of each record is less than the size of ablock.
Write a C++ program that reads an input Employee relation and builds a linear hashindex for the relation using attribute id. 
Increment the value ofnif the average number of records per each block exceeds80% of the block capacity. 
The input relation is stored in a CSV file, i.e., each tuple is in aseparate line and fields of each record are separated by commas.


For compiling the program: g++ main.cpp -o main.out
For running the program: ./main.out  or 
                         ./main.out L  or 
                         ./main.out M

The program accept switch C for index creation mode and L for lookup in itscommand line.
The switch L is succeeded by the value of input id.
